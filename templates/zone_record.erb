  # DNS TXT and SPF records have specific formatting requirements.
  #
  # 1. per RFC1035 section 3.3.14, they are composed of one or more
  # character strings.
  #
  # 2. per RFC1035 section 3.3, each character string can be up to 255
  # characters (section 3.3 indicates 256 octets, but includes the length
  # octet as part of that count).
  #
  # 3. per common usage, if a TXT record consists of multiple character
  # strings, the application processing that record concatenates the
  # character strings together with no intervening characters.
  #
  # 4. per RFC1035 section 5, if a character string includes spaces,
  # it must be enclosed in double-quotes ("). Within the double-quotes,
  # any character can occur except another double-quote; double-quotes
  # must be escaped by backslashes (\) (and by implication, backslashes
  # must also be escaped by backslashes).
  #
  # Based on these requirements, TXT and SPF records data items need
  # to be processed in this manner:
  #
  # 1.  split the data_item into 255 (at most) character chunks.
  #         (via `unpack` with a format string consisting of one 'a255'
  #         for every 255 characters in the data item, rounded up)
  #
  # 2.  escape all double-quotes and backslashes within each chunk by
  #     inserting a backslash before the escaped character.
  #         (via a `gsub` within a `collect` over the array of chunks)
  #
  # 3.  surround each chunk with double-quotes.
  #         (within the same `collect` over the array of chunks)
  #
  # 4.  join the chunks back together with a space between each chunk.
  #         (via `join(' ')`)
  #
  data_item = data_item.unpack('a255' * ((data_item.length / 255.0).ceil())).collect { |x| '"' + x.gsub(/([\\"])/, '\\\\\\1') + '"' }.join(' ')
